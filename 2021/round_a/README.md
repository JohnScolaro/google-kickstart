This was my first Google kickstart challenge and it was a blast. It was fun to
spent a few hours on the weekend thinking hard about some challenging problems.

I am reasonably pleased with the results, but I can easily see room for plently
of improvements. I only learned of the format of the input/output of the
challenges 20 mins prior to the start of the round, so I can save a few minutes
easily by creating a reasonable template for future problems.

I found solutions to questions 1, 2, and 3, but not 4. I solved all problem
sets for question 1, but question 2 and 3's solutions ran out of time when
attempting to solve the more difficult problem sets. I thought that my
solutions were actually quite efficient, and I don't think it would be too much
of a stretch to get future problems working faster.
